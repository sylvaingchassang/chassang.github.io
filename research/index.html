This pattern is suspicious in the following sense: it is inconsistent with competitive behavior under arbitrary information structures. Building on this observation, we develop a theory of data-driven regulation based on “safe tests.</i>

    <i>We ask whether Big Data, can reduce the cost of adverse selection in government-run capitation schemes. We  argue  that  using  data  to  improve  the  ex  ante  precision  of  capitation regressions is unlikely to be helpful. Instead, data can be used to align incentives  by  forming  unbiased and  non-manipulable  ex  post  estimates  of  a  private provider’s gains from selection.</i>

    <summary>abstract</summary>
    <i>Experiments take time to run. This means that traditional online bandit strategies don't apply: it is not possible to wait for each patient's outcome before deciding what treatment to give to the next patients. Experiments must be split into an handful of batches, with many participants experimenting in parallel. We study how to dynamically select treatment when constrained to experiment by batch. Three experimental batches are sufficent to approach online efficiency.</i>

<br /><em>Econometrica,</em> 2013</p>

<details style="margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:15px;width:85%;text-align:justify">
    <summary>abstract</summary>
    <i>This paper studies a dynamic agency problem which includes limited liability, moral hazard and adverse selection. The paper develops a robust approach to dynamic contracting based on calibrating the payoffs that would have been delivered by simple benchmark contracts that are attractive but infeasible, due to limited liability constraints. The resulting dynamic contracts are detail-free and satisfy robust performance bounds independently of the underlying process for returns, which need not be i.i.d. or even ergodic. </i>

<br />with Satoru Takahashi,<br /><em>Theoretical Economics,</em> 2011</p>

<details style="margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:15px;width:85%;text-align:justify">
    <summary>abstract</summary>
    <i>This paper extends the framework of Kajii and Morris (1997) to study the question of robustness to incomplete information in repeated games. We show that dynamically robust equilibria can be characterized using a one-shot robustness principle that extends the one-shot deviation principle. Using this result, we compute explicitly the set of dynamically robust equilibrium values in the repeated prisoners' dilemma. We show that robustness requirements have sharp intuitive implications regarding when cooperation can be sustained, what strategies are best suited to sustain cooperation, and how changes in payoffs affect the sustainability of cooperation. We also show that a folk theorem in dynamically robust equilibria holds, but requires stronger identifiability conditions than the pairwise full rank condition of Fudenberg, Levine and Maskin (1994).</i>

<details style="margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:15px;width:85%;text-align:justify">
    <summary>abstract</summary>
    <i>We examine the mechanics of deterrence and intervention under strategic risk, when fear is a motive for conflict. We define and distinguish predatory and preemptive incentives as determinants of conflict. We show that while weapons have an unambiguous deterrent effect under complete information, this does not hold anymore under strategic risk. Rather, we find that increases in weapon stocks can have a non-monotonic effect on the sustainability of peace. We also show that under strategic risk, inequality in military strength can actually facilitate peace and that anticipated peace-keeping interventions may improve incentives for peaceful behavior.</i>

<details style="margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:15px;width:85%;text-align:justify">
    <summary>abstract</summary>
    <i>This article revisits the relationship between income per capita and civil conflict. We begin by documenting that the empirical literature identifies two different patterns. First, poor countries have a higher propensity to suffer from civil war. Second, civil war occurs when countries suffer negative income shocks. In a formal model we examine an explanation often suggested in the informal literature: civil wars occur in poor countries because the opportunity cost of fighting is small. We show that while this explanation fails to make sense of the first empirical pattern, it provides a coherent theoretical basis for the second. We then enrich the model to allow for private imperfect information about the state of the economy and show that mutual fears exacerbate the problem caused by negative income shocks.</i>

<details style="margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:15px;width:85%;text-align:justify">
    <summary>abstract</summary>
    <i>We contrast the relationship between predation and the savings of its potential victim in two different simple models. In the first model, predation is an exogenous event in which savings are expropriated with some fixed probability. In such a setting, the higher the probability of expropriation the lower are savings. In the second model, we endow the predatory agent with a decision whether to expropriate or to devote his efforts to some productive endeavor. In this second model, the (endogenous) probability of expropriation can easily be positively correlated with savings. In addition, we show that predation is more damaging to the savings and utility of the victim in the second model.</i>
