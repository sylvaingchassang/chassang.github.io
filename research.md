      note: "Limits on a government’s capacity to enforce laws can result in multiple equilibria. If most agents comply, limited enforcement is sufficient to dissuade isolated agents from misbehaving. If most agents do not comply, overstretched enforcement capacity has a minimal impact on behavior. We study the extent to which divide-and-conquer enforcement strategies can help select a high compliance equilibrium in the presence of realistic compliance frictions. We study the role of information about the compliance of others both in theory and in lab experiments. As the number of agents gets large, theory indicates that providing information or not is irrelevant in equilibrium. In contrast, providing individualized information has a first order impact in experimental play by increasing convergence to equilibrium. This illustrates the value of out-of-equilibrium information design."

      note: "This paper seeks to measure the cost of imbalance with respect to gender in a sample of roughly 2000 clinical studies. We document significant imbalance: 25% of experiments have at least 26% more men in one treatment arm than in the other. In addition, clinical trials with greater imbalance have more dispersed treatment effects, indicating that imbalance reduces the informativeness of experiments. A simple structural model suggests that for a typical experiment, using a balanced random design could deliver informativeness gains equivalent to increasing the sample size by 18%."

      note: "We propose a theory of equilibrium antitrust oversight in which: (i) regulators
      launch investigations on the basis of suspicious bidding patters; (ii) cartels can adapt
      to the statistical screens used by regulators, and may in fact use
      them to enforce cartel compliance."

      note: "We evaluate secure survey design techniques seeking to improve 
      information transmission in high stakes settings. Systematic 
      deviations from equilibrium make randomized response techniques 
      surprisingly effective although they are strategically equivalent to 
      non-secure direct elicitation. Hard garbling provide durable 
      improvements in information transmission."

      url:   "/assets/papers/strategic_capitation.pdf"
      note: "We ask whether Big Data, can reduce the cost of adverse selection in government-run capitation schemes.  
      We  argue  that  using  data  to  improve  the  ex  ante  precision  of  capitation regressions is unlikely to be helpful.  
      Instead, data can be used to align incentives  by  forming  unbiased  
      and  non-manipulable  ex  post  estimates  of  a  private provider’s gains from selection."

     Regression Discontinuity Approach"

      url:   "/assets/papers/regression_discontinuity.pdf"
      note: "Cartels participating in procurement auctions frequently use
       bid rotation or incumbency priority to allocate market shares. However, establishing a tight link between observed allocation patterns and firm conduct has been difficult: there are cost-based
         competitive explanations for such behavior. We show that by
          focusing on the set of auctions in which the winning and losing bids are very close, it is possible to distinguish allocation patterns reflecting cost differences across firms from patterns reflecting non-competitive behavior. We apply our tests to two datasets: the sample of Ohio school milk auctions studied in Porter and Zona (1999), and a sample of municipal procurement auctions held in Japan."

      journal: "Theoretical Economics"
      internal: True
      url:   "/assets/papers/limited_liability_allocation.pdf"
      note: "A principal seeks to efficiently allocate a productive public resource to a number of possible users. Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms provide a detail-free way to do so provided users have deep pockets. In practice however, users may have limited resources. We study a dynamic allocation problem in which participants have limited liability: transfers are made ex post, and only if the productive efforts of participants are successful. We show that it is possible to approximate the performance of VCG using limited liability detail-free mechanisms that selectively ignore reports from participants who cannot make their promised payments. We emphasize the use of prior-free online optimization techniques to approximate aggregate incentive properties of VCG."

      note: "We document a novel bidding pattern observed in procurement auctions from Japan: winning bids tend to be isolated, and there is a missing mass of close losing bids. This pattern is suspicious in the following sense: its extreme forms are inconsistent with competitive behavior under arbitrary information structures. Building on this observation, we develop systematic tests of competitive behavior in procurement auctions that allow for general information structures as well as non-stationary unobserved heterogeneity. We provide an empirical exploration of our tests, and show they can help identify other suspicious patterns in the data."

      journal: Review of Economic Studies
      year: 2018
      note: "In many organizational settings, promised anonymity provides potential whistleblowers with little protection. The number of 
      informed agents is small, and identifying information may be leaked. We show that an effective intervention policy must provide
      possible whistleblowers with plausible deniability by garbling their messages, and discuss how to evaluate policy experimentations
      on the basis of unverifiable message data alone"

      note: "An investor with correct beliefs would not experience large drawdowns. 
      But how can we guarantee that beliefs are correct. Finite hidden state space models 
      are inherently stubborn and can lead to large drawdowns. The paper shows how to compute
      minmax dawdown strategies ensuring the best possible compromise between Fear-of-Loss and 
      Fear-of-Missing-Out."

      year: 2016
      note: "Justice is delivered by people, driven by moral intuition and 
      emotions. How does that change incentives? We develop a positive model of informal contracting in which 
      rewards and punishments are not determined by an ex ante optimal plan 
      but instead express the ex post moral sentiments of the arbitrating party."

      journal: Annals of Statistics
      year: 2016
      note: "Experiments take time to run. This means that traditional online bandit strategies don't apply: 
      it is not possible to wait for each patient's outcome before deciding what treatment to give to the next patients. 
      Experiments must be split into an handful of batches, with many participants experimenting in parallel. 
      We study how to dynamically select treatment when constrained to experiment by batch. 
      Three experimental batches are sufficent to approach online efficiency."

      journal: Econometrica
      year: 2013
      note: "This paper studies a dynamic agency problem which includes 
      limited liability, moral hazard and adverse selection. The paper 
      develops a robust approach to dynamic contracting based on calibrating 
      the payoffs that would have been delivered by simple benchmark contracts 
      that are attractive but infeasible, due to limited liability constraints. 
      The resulting dynamic contracts are detail-free and satisfy robust 
      performance bounds independently of the underlying process 
      for returns, which need not be i.i.d. or even ergodic. "

      note: "We study the design of randomized controlled experiments in 
      environments where outcomes are significantly affected by unobserved

      coauthors: 
        - s_takahashi
      journal: Theoretical Economics
      year: 2011
      note: "This paper extends the framework of Kajii and Morris (1997) to study the question of robustness to incomplete information in repeated games. We show that dynamically robust equilibria can be characterized using a one-shot robustness principle that extends the one-shot deviation principle. Using this result, we compute explicitly the set of dynamically robust equilibrium values in the repeated prisoners' dilemma. We show that robustness requirements have sharp intuitive implications regarding when cooperation can be sustained, what strategies are best suited to sustain cooperation, and how changes in payoffs affect the sustainability of cooperation. We also show that a folk theorem in dynamically robust equilibria holds, but requires stronger identifiability conditions than the pairwise full rank condition of Fudenberg, Levine and Maskin (1994)."

      journal:   Quarterly Journal of Economics
      year:  2010
      note: "We examine the mechanics of deterrence and intervention under strategic risk, 
      when fear is a motive for conflict. We define and distinguish predatory and 
      preemptive incentives as determinants of conflict. We show that while 
      weapons have an unambiguous deterrent effect under complete information,
      this does not hold anymore under strategic risk. Rather, we find that 
      increases in weapon stocks can have a non-monotonic effect on 
      the sustainability of peace. We also show that under strategic risk, 
      inequality in military strength can actually facilitate peace and 
      that anticipated peace-keeping interventions may improve incentives 
      for peaceful behavior."

      title: Fear of Miscoordination and the Robustness of Cooperation in Dynamic Global Games with Exit  
      journal:  Econometrica
      year:  2010
      note: "How does rational paranoia change the way players cooperate? 
      In contrast to complete information models, miscoordination payoffs 
      play an important role in determining whether cooperation is sustainable 
      or not. This changes comparative statics in many games of interest."

      journal:  Quarterly Journal of Political Science
      year:  2010
      note: "This article revisits the relationship between income per capita and civil conflict. We begin by documenting that the empirical literature identifies two different patterns. First, poor countries have a higher propensity to suffer from civil war. Second, civil war occurs when countries suffer negative income shocks. In a formal model we examine an explanation often suggested in the informal literature: civil wars occur in poor countries because the opportunity cost of fighting is small. We show that while this explanation fails to make sense of the first empirical pattern, it provides a coherent theoretical basis for the second. We then enrich the model to allow for private imperfect information about the state of the economy and show that mutual fears exacerbate the problem caused by negative income shocks."

      journal:  Journal of the European Economic Association (Papers and Proceedings)
      year:  2010
      note: "We contrast the relationship between predation and the 
      savings of its potential victim in two different simple 
      models. In the first model, predation is an exogenous event in which savings are expropriated with some fixed probability. In such a setting, the higher the probability of expropriation the lower are savings. In the second model, we endow the predatory agent with a decision whether to expropriate or to devote his efforts to some productive endeavor. In this second model, the (endogenous) probability of expropriation can easily be positively correlated with savings. 
      In addition, we show that predation is more damaging to the savings and utility of the victim in the second model."
