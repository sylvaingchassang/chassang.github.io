      note: "We propose a theory of equilibrium antitrust oversight in which: (i) regulators
      launch investigations on the basis of suspicious bidding patters; (ii) cartels can adapt
      to the statistical screens used by regulators, and may in fact use
      them to enforce cartel compliance."

      url:   "/assets/papers/secure_survey_design.pdf"
      note: "We evaluate secure survey design techniques seeking to improve 
      information transmission in high stakes settings. Systematic 
      deviations from equilibrium make randomized response techniques 
      surprisingly effective although they are strategically equivalent to 
      non-secure direct elicitation. Hard garbling provide durable 
      improvements in information transmission."

      url:   "/assets/papers/data_driven_antitrust.pdf"
      note: "We document a novel bidding pattern observed in procurement 
      auctions from Japan: winning bids tend to be isolated. There is a 
      missing mass of close losing bids. This pattern is suspicious in the 
      following sense: it is inconsistent with competitive behavior under 
      arbitrary information structures. Building on this observation, we develop a theory of data-driven regulation based on “safe tests."

      url:   "/assets/papers/strategic_capitation.pdf"
      note: "We ask whether Big Data, can reduce the cost of adverse selection in government-run capitation schemes.  
      We  argue  that  using  data  to  improve  the  ex  ante  precision  of  capitation regressions is unlikely to be helpful.  
      Instead, data can be used to align incentives  by  forming  unbiased  
      and  non-manipulable  ex  post  estimates  of  a  private provider’s gains from selection."

      coauthors:

      journal: Review of Economic Studies
      year: 2018
      note: "In many organizational settings, promised anonymity provides potential whistleblowers with little protection. The number of 
      informed agents is small, and identifying information may be leaked. We show that an effective intervention policy must provide
      possible whistleblowers with plausible deniability by garbling their messages, and discuss how to evaluate policy experimentations
      on the basis of unverifiable message data alone"

      journal: Journal of Risk
      year: 2018
      note: "An investor with correct beliefs would not experience large drawdowns. 
      But how can we guarantee that beliefs are correct. Finite hidden state space models 
      are inherently stubborn and can lead to large drawdowns. The paper shows how to compute
      minmax dawdown strategies ensuring the best possible compromise between Fear-of-Loss and 
      Fear-of-Missing-Out."

      journal : Handbook of Field Experiments
      year: 2017
      note: "We propose a decision-theoretic model of why and when experimenters choose to randomize. We then use this framework to shed light on questions 
      related to experimental registries, pre-analysis plans, and 
      most importantly, external validity."

      coauthors: 
        - c_zehnder 
      journal: Theoretical Economics
      year: 2016
      note: "Justice is delivered by people, driven by moral intuition and 
      emotions. How does that change incentives? We develop a positive model of informal contracting in which 
      rewards and punishments are not determined by an ex ante optimal plan 
      but instead express the ex post moral sentiments of the arbitrating party."

        - e_snowberg
      journal: Annals of Statistics
      year: 2016
      note: "Experiments take time to run. This means that traditional online bandit strategies don't apply: 
      it is not possible to wait for each patient's outcome before deciding what treatment to give to the next patients. 
      Experiments must be split into an handful of batches, with many participants experimenting in parallel. 
      We study how to dynamically select treatment when constrained to experiment by batch. 
      Three experimental batches are sufficent to approach online efficiency."

        - b_seymour 
      journal: PLoS One
      year: 2015
      note: "When drug efficacy changes with the participant's behavior, 
      the probability with which patients are in the control vs treatment group 
      has an impact on measured treatment effect and standard RCTs can 
      be improved on."

      title: "Calibrated Incentive Contracts"
      journal: Econometrica
      year: 2013
      note: "This paper studies a dynamic agency problem which includes 
      limited liability, moral hazard and adverse selection. The paper 
      develops a robust approach to dynamic contracting based on calibrating 
      the payoffs that would have been delivered by simple benchmark contracts 
      that are attractive but infeasible, due to limited liability constraints. 
      The resulting dynamic contracts are detail-free and satisfy robust 
      performance bounds independently of the underlying process 
      for returns, which need not be i.i.d. or even ergodic. "

        - e_snowberg
      journal: American Economic Review
      year: 2012
      note: "We study the design of randomized controlled experiments in 
      environments where outcomes are significantly affected by unobserved 
      effort decisions taken by the subjects. The unobservability 
      of effort provision compromises external validity. Natural extensions of 
      RCTs can help improve the external 
      validity of experiments."

      title: "Robustness to Incomplete Information in Repeated Games"
      coauthors: 
        - s_takahashi
      journal: Theoretical Economics
      year: 2011
      note: "This paper extends the framework of Kajii and Morris (1997) to study the question of robustness to incomplete information in repeated games. We show that dynamically robust equilibria can be characterized using a one-shot robustness principle that extends the one-shot deviation principle. Using this result, we compute explicitly the set of dynamically robust equilibrium values in the repeated prisoners' dilemma. We show that robustness requirements have sharp intuitive implications regarding when cooperation can be sustained, what strategies are best suited to sustain cooperation, and how changes in payoffs affect the sustainability of cooperation. We also show that a folk theorem in dynamically robust equilibria holds, but requires stronger identifiability conditions than the pairwise full rank condition of Fudenberg, Levine and Maskin (1994)."

      title: "Conflict and Deterrence under Strategic Risk"
      coauthors:   
        - g_padro 
      journal:   Quarterly Journal of Economics
      year:  2010
      note: "We examine the mechanics of deterrence and intervention under strategic risk, 
      when fear is a motive for conflict. We define and distinguish predatory and 
      preemptive incentives as determinants of conflict. We show that while 
      weapons have an unambiguous deterrent effect under complete information,
      this does not hold anymore under strategic risk. Rather, we find that 
      increases in weapon stocks can have a non-monotonic effect on 
      the sustainability of peace. We also show that under strategic risk, 
      inequality in military strength can actually facilitate peace and 
      that anticipated peace-keeping interventions may improve incentives 
      for peaceful behavior."

      title: Fear of Miscoordination and the Robustness of Cooperation in Dynamic Global Games with Exit  
      journal:  Econometrica
      year:  2010
      note: "How does rational paranoia change the way players cooperate? 
      In contrast to complete information models, miscoordination payoffs 
      play an important role in determining whether cooperation is sustainable 
      or not. This changes comparative statics in many games of interest."

      title: "Building Routines: Learning, Cooperation and the Dynamics of Incomplete Relational Contracts"

      when the details of cooperation are not common knowledge?"

      title: "Economic Shocks and Civil War" 
      coauthors :   
        - g_padro
      journal:  Quarterly Journal of Political Science
      year:  2010
      note: "This article revisits the relationship between income per capita and civil conflict. We begin by documenting that the empirical literature identifies two different patterns. First, poor countries have a higher propensity to suffer from civil war. Second, civil war occurs when countries suffer negative income shocks. In a formal model we examine an explanation often suggested in the informal literature: civil wars occur in poor countries because the opportunity cost of fighting is small. We show that while this explanation fails to make sense of the first empirical pattern, it provides a coherent theoretical basis for the second. We then enrich the model to allow for private imperfect information about the state of the economy and show that mutual fears exacerbate the problem caused by negative income shocks."

      title: "Savings and Predation"
      coauthors:   
        - g_padro  
      journal:  Journal of the European Economic Association (Papers and Proceedings)
      year:  2010
      note: "We contrast the relationship between predation and the 
      savings of its potential victim in two different simple 
      models. In the first model, predation is an exogenous event in which savings are expropriated with some fixed probability. In such a setting, the higher the probability of expropriation the lower are savings. In the second model, we endow the predatory agent with a decision whether to expropriate or to devote his efforts to some productive endeavor. In this second model, the (endogenous) probability of expropriation can easily be positively correlated with savings. 
      In addition, we show that predation is more damaging to the savings and utility of the victim in the second model."
